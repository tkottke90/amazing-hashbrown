# AGENT.md — api

Express REST API for the local LLM agent harness. TypeScript, ESM
(`"type": "module"`, `NodeNext` module resolution — import local files with
explicit `.js` extensions).

See the root `AGENT.md` for repo-wide conventions and the required
pre-commit checks.

## Layout

```
src/
  agents/           LangChain agent/chain definitions and streaming chat handlers
  config/           Environment config (env.ts loads .env via dotenv)
  knowledge-base/   Domain-organized knowledge bases (LLM-Wiki pattern) — one
                     subfolder per domain under knowledge-base/domains/
  routes/           Express routers. All backend routes are versioned and
                     nested under /api/v1 (routes/v1/*); app.ts mounts
                     routes/index.ts at /api
  types/            Shared API types
  app.ts            Express app factory (routes + static hosting)
  index.ts          Server entrypoint — reads env.port, calls app.listen
test/               Mocha + Chai tests
public/             Static files served at the app root by express.static.
                     This checked-in copy is a dev-only placeholder; in the
                     Docker image it's replaced by the built ui app
```

## Adding a route

New routes go under `src/routes/v1/`, mounted onto `v1Router` in
`src/routes/v1/index.ts`. Don't add unversioned routes at `/api/*` directly —
everything hangs off `/api/v1` so future breaking changes can live at
`/api/v2` without disrupting existing clients.

## Environment

Config is loaded from `.env` (see `.env.example`) via the `dotenv` package in
`src/config/env.ts`, and read through the exported `env` object — don't read
`process.env` directly elsewhere.

## Commands (run from `api/`, or with `--workspace api` from the repo root)

```sh
npm run dev      # tsx watch src/index.ts
npm run build    # tsc -p tsconfig.json -> dist/
npm start        # node dist/index.js (run build first)
npm test         # mocha (test/**/*.test.ts)
```

Linting and formatting are configured at the repo root — run `npm run lint`
/ `npx prettier --check .` from the repo root, not from `api/`.

## Before committing

Tests, linting, and style checks must all pass — see the root `AGENT.md`
checklist. For changes scoped to `api/`, at minimum run `npm test` here and
`npm run lint` from the repo root before committing.
