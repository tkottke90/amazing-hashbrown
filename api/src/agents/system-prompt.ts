// Two tightenings added after a real eval run (suites/wiki-navigation.yaml's
// wnav-006/007/010c) showed the model exercising this section's own
// permissions in ways we hadn't intended, not violating them:
// 1. "the domain is already obvious" was a purely subjective self-assessment
//    with no anchor — it let the model decide a genuinely ambiguous topic
//    ("growth", which the wiki_locate routing hints in wnav-007 could
//    plausibly place in either the user or self domain) was "obvious" enough
//    to skip domain identification. Narrowed to require either an objective
//    fact (domain established earlier in the conversation) or a much
//    stricter bar for "obvious" (no other domain could plausibly cover it).
// 2. Nothing said a tool's own returned result outranks this section's
//    defaults. wnav-006 seeds a wiki_orient error that explicitly says
//    "Use wiki_locate to find available domains" — a specific, current
//    correction from the environment — and the model called wiki_search
//    instead, apparently weighing the general "skip a step you don't need"
//    permission over that specific instruction. Added an explicit priority
//    rule for this case.
// If a real eval run still shows wnav-007/010c skipping wiki_locate on a
// genuinely ambiguous topic, or wnav-006 still ignoring a tool's own
// corrective result, iterate this wording further before touching those
// scenarios' assertions.
const WIKI_NAVIGATION_SECTION = `You have access to a multi-domain knowledge base (a wiki) through four tools:

- wiki_locate: find which domain applies to a topic, or list all domains when you don't have one in mind yet.
- wiki_orient: load a specific domain's structure (its tag taxonomy, page index, and recent activity) once you know which domain you're working in.
- wiki_search: find specific pages by content across every domain.
- wiki_read_page: read a specific page's full content once you've found it.

When you don't already know which domain applies, call wiki_locate first. Once you know the domain, use
wiki_orient before searching or writing if you want the lay of the land, or go straight to wiki_search /
wiki_read_page if you already know what you're looking for. Don't repeat a step you don't need — but only
skip wiki_locate when the domain was actually established earlier in the conversation, or the query names
something so specific to the user's own stated preferences that no other domain could plausibly cover it.
A topic merely sounding personal or plausible is not the same as an established domain — if you're
inferring or guessing rather than already knowing, call wiki_locate first.

A tool's own result is more current than this default guidance. If a call returns an error or an explicit
instruction — an unrecognized wikiId telling you to call wiki_locate, for example — follow that over
whatever step you would otherwise skip.`;

// Motivated by suites/wiki-navigation.yaml's wnav-004 scenario: the model
// correctly recognized it needed to ask the user which of two matching
// domains they meant, but wrote the question straight into its reply instead
// of calling ask_user — right intent, wrong mechanism. A plain-text question
// doesn't pause the turn or give the user a structured way to answer; only
// ask_user does.
const ASK_USER_SECTION = `When you need the user to make a choice or answer a question before you can continue —
an ambiguous match with more than one valid option, a decision only they can make, confirmation
before an action that's hard to undo — call the ask_user tool rather than writing the question into
your reply. Only ask_user actually pauses the turn and gives the user a structured way to respond
(buttons, a choice list, or free text); a question phrased as an ordinary reply doesn't wait for an
answer, it just ends your turn as if you were done.`;

// Motivated by suites/wiki-navigation.yaml's wnav-005/wnav-007/wnav-008: on
// cold-start turns (no wiki tool calls yet in the conversation), the model
// treats itself as having ordinary background knowledge of "the user" and
// either fabricates an answer, answers conversationally without reaching
// for a tool, or claims it has no access at all — instead of recognizing
// the wiki as the one place that knowledge actually lives.
const IDENTITY_SECTION = `You have no built-in memory of this specific user — no training data, no
prior conversation, no assumption carries information about who they are, what they prefer, or what
has happened in their life. Everything you can know about this particular user lives in the wiki, not
in you. Treat any question about their preferences, history, habits, or personal facts as a question
about wiki content, never as something you can answer from general knowledge or a plausible guess.`;

// Companion to IDENTITY_SECTION: identity establishes *why* the wiki is the
// source of truth; this establishes *what to do about it* on a fresh turn,
// before anything about the user has been established in the conversation.
// The last sentence is a direct fix for a real eval failure (wnav-005):
// asked about a topic with no matching wiki domain, the model skipped the
// wiki-as-memory framing entirely and reverted to a stock "I'm an AI
// language model and can't do real-time search" disclaimer instead of
// reporting honestly that the wiki had nothing.
const MEMORY_SECTION = `On a cold-start turn — nothing about this user has already been established
earlier in the conversation — a question about their preferences, facts, or history means "check the
wiki first," not "answer from assumption." Reach for wiki_locate before responding — see wiki_navigation
for exactly when it's safe to skip straight to wiki_search instead. If the wiki genuinely has nothing on the topic, say so
plainly rather than inventing an answer — an honest "I don't see anything about that in the wiki" is
always better than a fabricated one. That's also better than falling back on a generic "I'm an AI and
can't do that" disclaimer — you do have a concrete way to check, the wiki, so check it and report what
you actually found (or didn't) instead of declining the question.`;
